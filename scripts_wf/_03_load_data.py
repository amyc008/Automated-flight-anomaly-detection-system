# 03_load_data.py
"""
Load OpenFlights data files into MariaDB tables.

Changes made:
- Uses DB_CONFIG and PATHS from config.py (no hard-coded host/user/password).
- Reads input files from PATHS['raw_csv'] (falls back to PATHS['base'] if not set).
- Ensures PATHS['outputs'] exists and writes a small CSV/text summary of loaded row counts.
- Exposes run() -> str which returns a human-readable summary (useful for CLI or GUI later).
- Keeps existing behavior for LOAD DATA LOCAL INFILE but enables it safely.
